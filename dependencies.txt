python pexpect - for jphs
python vte - for terminal support in tools 
java - for openstego, exif(metadata-extractor2), f5 - need java 7 or greater
wine - needed to use Windows executables (jphs, stegbreak only work on Windows version of jphs)
vb6run (for stegspy) - this is now done automatically with a custom wineprefix and winetricks
